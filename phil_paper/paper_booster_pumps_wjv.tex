%This paper analyzes how sharing connections affects optimal pricing for water utilities. 

	% Households often share connections to public utilities with their neighbors in order to split set-up and maintenance costs.  With microdata from 1.5 million water connections in Manila, this paper estimates water demand when connections are shared and solves the regulator's problem: setting prices that maximize consumer surplus while covering production costs.  In practice, cities often set low fixed prices so that more households connect and high marginal prices to cover production costs.  Instead, the optimal policy covers production costs with high fixed prices, which are split between sharing households, and sets low marginal prices to encourage consumption.  Counterfactual exercises find increases in shared connections, total piped water consumption, and social welfare from the optimal policy compared to current prices in Manila.

%Sharing households split fixed prices with their neighbors to access the low marginal prices.  

%	Yet, I find that low fixed and high marginal prices also weaken incentives to share water between neighbors.

%	Sharing neighbor's connections 
% In developing cities, high costs of connecting to piped water lead many households to use low-quality, non-piped sources.  
% In response, cities often set low fixed prices so that more households connect and high marginal prices to cover production costs.  
% This paper identifies a common alternative source --- sharing a neighbor's connection --- that has large implications for optimal water pricing.
