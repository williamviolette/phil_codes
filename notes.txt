notes

8/23/18 :

	- new sampling procedure : do random barangays, then random accounts within (to ensure enough neighbors !)  Issue: over-representation of small barangays (redo with 3?)

	- complete alt_sub like we used to (maybe doublecheck later)
		- UPDATE (8/28/19): actually replaced by pollfish (but its ok to have anyways)

8/24/18 :

	- split leaks into three files, leaks.do (defines leaks), leaks_sample.do (outputs sample), leaks_graph.do (makes graphs)

	- do robustness both WITH and WITHOUT Barangay oversampling..  * could make a table comparing means

	- put all output into generated folder

	- how do I handle estimating SHH? does it enter into controls? because that's a problem ... * no i think its ok in estimation (just divide by SHH..)

8/27/18 :

	- [nte] found proper code! make sure it all lines up!!

	- [chk] do leaks graphs still !

	- [chk] the cut for HH size is actually with percentiles in generate_controls.m (change in paper?)

	- [arg] need to make more extensive descriptive tables for the appendix!!!

8/28/18 :

	- [arg] the key is cutting above 100 c  (then get the exact same elasticity)

	- [arg] the leaks graph has a pre-trend (maybe worth addressing head-on but also could just discuss and show its not bias but might bias)

	- [arg] using square geography sounds good as a conservative approach (making sharing least likely!) and mention this; drive up the fixed cost estimate for sure
		- what is the alternative? mention these limitations! 
			- no distances for sharers (could draw number between zero and nearest connection; make up distribution)
			- sampling for neighbors (one neighbor's distance is different from another's if they are sampled together; hard to know)

	- [arg] in discussion focus on the heterogeneity of the p_H effect!!! 

8/29/18 :
	
	- [arg] think about using similar prose from papers that use similar structural techniques

	- [arg] why don't I use own house type for PH heterogeneity? (because its imputed ; mention this clearly in the paper)

	- [arg] ALSO DON'T KNOW WHERE THE ALTERNATIVE USERS ARE SO NEED LOCAL CHARACTERISTICS (can I randomly allocate them in space??)
		- HUGE limitation to the spatial aspect that I have to mention!!

	- [chk] data_prep_smm_grouping_v2.m : make sure that PH aggregates (NOW THAT IT HAS MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES) 

	- [nte] the triangles produce crazy high hassle costs (unrealistic); instead lets just use avg closest distance (probably decent and smaller...)

	- [chk] 1. Rename confusing file names? [some done]  2. have ph and standard tags differently? [done]

8/30/18 :

	- [nte] --> results folder
		- correlationestimates_group.csv , smm_group_[est_version].csv , 

	- [arg] why don't I include consumption values in counterfactuals ?? easy to re-run? do I get weird stuff for alt users? mean consumption would probably be fine...

9/5/18 :
	
	- [nte] mention that the lines are jagged in the new counterfactual graph because of the grid size... or fix! ...
		- or just run a smoother over it... [done]

	- [chk] go back and fix directories so that .tex files export to the right place from Matlab! [done]

9/6/18 :

	- [nte] MEAN_INC.csv HARD CODED IN first best graph

9/10/18 :
	
	- [chk] get rid of bootstrapping procedure for hassle cost section [done]

	- [chk] rewrite the disconnection policy section with new figures : DOuble-check back of the envelope calculations!!

	- [chk] need to relabel the controls!  (now I'm using different ones) [done]

	- [chk] need to include descriptives for the control variables too! (at least percentages in the main estimation sample...; just be super transparent about it)

	- [nte] think about how to explain results now in terms of correlation of ph with different subgroups? like poorer areas? is this heterogeneity important? (do counterfactual where everyone gets the same 15 ph)  ;  ph might be sort of an implicit price discrimination

	- [chk] get the right number of households for table 3 (discuss how some HHs are dropped, how we create these little neighborhoods)

	- [chk] make separate descriptive tables for step 1 and step 3 [maybe not...]

	- [chk] look at presentations for extra tables! (like the one testing the representativeness of different samples!) 

	- [chk] put volumes in counterfactuals!

9/14/18 :

	- [chk] make undersampling table [maybe not...]
	
	- [chk] refer to pres (add other shared goods in motivation)

	- [chk] need to put in model fit!! for SMM and explain moments more clearly!

	- [chk] what are some tests I can do on the distance metric, for it to make sense?

9/17/18 :

	- [chk] write in where consumption goes!!

9/18/18 :

	- [chk] use [chk] notation for things to fix in the paper

	- [chk] write about consumption findings in the beginning!! (export the findings???)
 
 	- [chk] in model motivation, refer to more prior literature!

9/20/18 :

	- [chk] lower pressure, lower quality, time spent fetching (reiterate)

	- [chk] "hard-to-measure" costs - permits repairs, land tenure, etc.

	- [chk] water shock, preference shock
