notes

8/23/18 :

	- new sampling procedure : do random barangays, then random accounts within (to ensure enough neighbors !)  Issue: over-representation of small barangays (redo with 3?)

	- complete alt_sub like we used to (maybe doublecheck later)
		- UPDATE (8/28/19): actually replaced by pollfish (but its ok to have anyways)

8/24/18 :

	- split leaks into three files, leaks.do (defines leaks), leaks_sample.do (outputs sample), leaks_graph.do (makes graphs)

	- do robustness both WITH and WITHOUT Barangay oversampling..  * could make a table comparing means

	- put all output into generated folder

	- how do I handle estimating SHH? does it enter into controls? because that's a problem ... * no i think its ok in estimation (just divide by SHH..)

8/27/18 :

	- found proper code! make sure it all lines up!!

	- do leaks graphs still !

	- the cut for HH size is actually with percentiles in generate_controls.m (change in paper?)

	- need to make more extensive descriptive tables for the appendix!!!

8/28/18 :

	- the key is cutting above 100 c  (then get the exact same elasticity)

	- the leaks graph has a pre-trend (maybe worth addressing head-on but also could just discuss and show its not bias but might bias)

	- using square geography sounds good as a conservative approach (making sharing least likely!) and mention this; drive up the fixed cost estimate for sure
		- what is the alternative? mention these limitations! 
			- no distances for sharers (could draw number between zero and nearest connection; make up distribution)
			- sampling for neighbors (one neighbor's distance is different from another's if they are sampled together; hard to know)

	- in discussion focus on the heterogeneity of the p_H effect!!! 

8/29/18 :
	
	- think about using similar prose from papers that use similar structural techniques
