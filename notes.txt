notes

8/23/18 :

	- new sampling procedure : do random barangays, then random accounts within (to ensure enough neighbors !)  Issue: over-representation of small barangays (redo with 3?)

	- complete alt_sub like we used to (maybe doublecheck later)
		- UPDATE (8/28/19): actually replaced by pollfish (but its ok to have anyways)

8/24/18 :

	- split leaks into three files, leaks.do (defines leaks), leaks_sample.do (outputs sample), leaks_graph.do (makes graphs)

	- do robustness both WITH and WITHOUT Barangay oversampling..  * could make a table comparing means

	- put all output into generated folder

	- how do I handle estimating SHH? does it enter into controls? because that's a problem ... * no i think its ok in estimation (just divide by SHH..)

8/27/18 :

	- [nte] found proper code! make sure it all lines up!!

	- [chk] do leaks graphs still !

	- [chk] the cut for HH size is actually with percentiles in generate_controls.m (change in paper?)

	- [arg] need to make more extensive descriptive tables for the appendix!!!

8/28/18 :

	- [arg] the key is cutting above 100 c  (then get the exact same elasticity)

	- [arg] the leaks graph has a pre-trend (maybe worth addressing head-on but also could just discuss and show its not bias but might bias)

	- [arg] using square geography sounds good as a conservative approach (making sharing least likely!) and mention this; drive up the fixed cost estimate for sure
		- what is the alternative? mention these limitations! 
			- no distances for sharers (could draw number between zero and nearest connection; make up distribution)
			- sampling for neighbors (one neighbor's distance is different from another's if they are sampled together; hard to know)

	- [arg] in discussion focus on the heterogeneity of the p_H effect!!! 

8/29/18 :
	
	- [arg] think about using similar prose from papers that use similar structural techniques

	- [arg] why don't I use own house type for PH heterogeneity? (because its imputed ; mention this clearly in the paper)

	- [arg] ALSO DON'T KNOW WHERE THE ALTERNATIVE USERS ARE SO NEED LOCAL CHARACTERISTICS (can I randomly allocate them in space??)
		- HUGE limitation to the spatial aspect that I have to mention!!

	- [chk] data_prep_smm_grouping_v2.m : make sure that PH aggregates (NOW THAT IT HAS MULTIPLE ATTRIBUTES) 

	- [nte] the triangles produce crazy high hassle costs (unrealistic); instead lets just use avg closest distance (probably decent and smaller...)

	- [chk] 1. Rename confusing file names? [some done]  2. have ph and standard tags differently? [done]

8/30/18 :

	- [nte] --> results folder
		- correlationestimates_group.csv , smm_group_[est_version].csv ,
